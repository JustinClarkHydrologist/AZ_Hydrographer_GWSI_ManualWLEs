-This program takes data from 2 excel files and creates graphs that stand alone as PNG files.

-The excel files contain water level data and well construction data from wells in ADWRs GWSI database.

-The PNG files generated are saved to a singular folder which is easy to change.

-This program includes a for loop to make all the PNG files.

-This version (version 2.3) is a clean version that just makes PNG files and a CSV file.

-Pandas and matplotlib are the primary libraries used for this program.

Designed for use by Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR) Groundwater Flow and Transport Modelers to Process the input data for MODFLOW Models and PEST Calibration Runs.
