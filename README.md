Program Author: Justin Clark

-This program takes data from 2 excel files and creates graphs that stand alone as PNG files.

-The excel files contain water level data and well construction data from wells in ADWRs GWSI database.

-The PNG files generated are saved to a singular folder which is easy to change.

-This program includes a for loop to make all the PNG files.

-This version (version 2.6) is a clean version that just makes PNG files with simple styling.

-Pandas and matplotlib are the primary libraries used for this program.

-Designed for use by Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR) Groundwater Flow and Transport Modelers to Process the input data for MODFLOW Models and PEST Calibration Runs.
